# Dragon-Ball-Z - Term Project
Created by: Fausto J Leyva


My dragon ball z game is based off of the show Dragon Ball Z. I used the pygame module to construct it. And it is a semi-side scroller in which the first two levels only advance to the next enemy after you defeat him and advance to the right. I control the user using the keyboard and use the proximity of the user and his attacks to decide the moves of the enemies. The last boss can also chase the user in the air.

In order to run the program, the person must make sure every file is in its corresponding folder and must have a text editor with python installed. Additionally, the pygame module must be installed. After installing pygame and making sure everything is in its right folder, run the code and the program should run correctly.
